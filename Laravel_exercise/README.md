### TEST FINISHED

# BCCH Digital Full-Stack Coding Exercise

## Instructions:

-   To initiate the exercise, fork this repository as private, and invite <nigel.stewart@bcchdigital.ca>, <malinda.kulasekare@bcchdigital.ca>, and <rachel.teo@bcchdigital.ca> with read-only access. Starting with this bootstrapped Laravel project, provide a solution to the project requirements stated below.

-   Project dependencies can be installed via `composer install` command within the root directory.

```php
/**
* Note: You will need to run this command from within a PHP enviroment.
* If you need a dev environment to get started, Laravel offers a pre-built
* Vagrant box called Homestead. https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/homestead
*/
```

-   The exercise has a max time limit of 48 hours.

-   To complete the exercise, commit your code and modify the README.md with 'Test finished'.

## Requirements:

-   Implement basic user authentication.
-   Design a REST API that will allow a user to have a collection of posts which will contain at the very least a title and content. Posts will be treated as a resource, and thus should have all associated CRUD functionality.
-   All posts will be aggregated into one main front-page view _(Think along the lines of a message board or news feed Ã  la Hacker News, Reddit, etc.)_.
-   Use PHPUnit to write tests that cover functionality of each of the post resources endpoints and any additional utility functions you may have created.
-   Create seeders to generate some users and posts.

## Bonus points:

-   Add a **listener** and **event** that will fire whenever a post is viewed, to notify the owner of the post.
-   Create a notification counter UI element that will inform the user how many times their posts have been viewed since last visit.
-   Posts to be sorted in order of highest view count, then date.

### Other tips:

Laravel comes out of the box with everything you should need to complete the exercise so you shouldn't require any additional packages.
